        Metallica is an American heavy metal band. The band was formed in 1981
        in Los Angeles by vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars
        Ulrich, and has been based in San Francisco for most of its career. The
        band's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship made them
        one of the founding "big four" bands of thrash metal, alongside
        Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer. Metallica's current lineup comprises
        founding members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime
        lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave
        Mustaine (who went on to form Megadeth after being fired from the band)
        and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former
        members of the band. Metallica first found commercial success with the
        release of its third album, Master of Puppets (1986), cited as one of
        the heaviest metal albums and the band's best work. The band's next
        album, ...And Justice for All (1988), gave Metallica its first Grammy
        Award nomination. Their eponymous fifth album, Metallica (1991), was the
        band's first not to root predominantly in thrash metal. It appealed to a
        more mainstream audience, achieving substantial commercial success and
        selling over 16 million copies in the United States to date; making it
        the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. After experimenting with
        different genres and directions in subsequent releases, Metallica
        returned to its thrash metal roots with the release of its ninth album,
        Death Magnetic (2008), which drew similar praise to that of the band's
        earlier albums. The band's most recent album is Hardwired... to
        Self-Destruct (2016).

        the most commercially successful bands of all time, having sold over 125

        list. As of 2017, Metallica is the third best-selling music artist since
        Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991, selling a total of 58
        million albums in the United States.
